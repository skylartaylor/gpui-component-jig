# gpui-base Text Selection Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Implement renderer-neutral window text selection in `gpui-base`, prove it with a plain adapter, and migrate TextView without changing its behavior.

**Architecture:** A window-local `TextSelectionHost` owns generic region endpoints and event coordination. Base-owned `TextSelectionRegion` entities erase renderer types; plain runs use base geometry while TextView attaches advanced copy, focus, scrolling, and virtual-block adapters.

**Tech Stack:** Rust, GPUI entities/elements/hitboxes/TextLayout, `gpui::test` visual tests.

## Global Constraints

- `gpui-base` must not depend on `gpui-component`, TextView, Markdown, HTML, Dialog, or Sheet types.
- Every runnable checkpoint has one authoritative selection state.
- Existing TextView behavior and builders remain compatible.
- Old component-layer window methods may be deprecated only after forwarding to the base host.
- Endpoints use region-relative content coordinates; scope and document order are explicit.
- Production changes follow red-green-refactor and preserve unrelated `.github/workflows/release.yml` work.

### Task 1: Base host, regions, and gesture contract

**Files:**
- Create: `crates/base/src/text_selection.rs`
- Modify: `crates/base/src/lib.rs`
- Test: `crates/base/src/text_selection.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `TextSelectionHost`, `TextSelectionController`, `TextSelectionRegion`, `SelectionScopeId`, `SelectionRegionFrame`, `SelectionSnapshot`, and `WindowTextSelectionExt`.
- Consumes: GPUI window events, `GlobalState` suppression, and `AutoScroll` commands through region callbacks.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing base contract tests**

Create fake regions backed by `Entity<TextSelectionRegionState>`. Test begin,
update, end, stable Shift anchor, reversed extension, cross-region ordering,
scope exclusion, suppression, dead-region fallback, and clear/has/copy through
`WindowTextSelectionExt`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify RED**

Run:

```bash
cargo test -p gpui-base text_selection --lib
```

Expected: compilation fails because the new public types and methods do not yet
exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the minimum host interface**

Start with these renderer-neutral types:

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, Default, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]
pub struct SelectionScopeId(u64);

#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct TextSelectionRegion(Entity<TextSelectionRegionState>);

pub struct SelectionRegionFrame {
    pub hitbox: Hitbox,
    pub bounds: Bounds<Pixels>,
    pub scroll_offset: Point<Pixels>,
    pub scope: SelectionScopeId,
    pub document_order: u64,
    pub text_bounds: Vec<Bounds<Pixels>>,
}

pub trait WindowTextSelectionExt {
    fn selected_text(&mut self, cx: &mut App) -> String;
    fn has_text_selection(&mut self, cx: &mut App) -> bool;
    fn clear_text_selection(&mut self, cx: &mut App);
    fn end_text_selection(&mut self, cx: &mut App);
}
```

Port anchor/cursor, capture/bubble choreography, proxy endpoints, scope checks,
weak-region pruning, and logical copy ordering behind the host interface.

- [ ] **Step 4: Verify GREEN and refactor**

Run:

```bash
cargo test -p gpui-base text_selection --lib
cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

Expected: all base selection contracts pass.

---

### Task 2: Plain text-run adapter

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/base/src/text_selection.rs`
- Test: `crates/base/src/text_selection.rs`
- Create: `crates/base/examples/selectable_text.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: region selection snapshots from Task 1 and GPUI `TextLayout`.
- Produces: `SelectionRunFrame`, `SelectionRunState`, and a plain selectable-text example usable without TextView.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing run projection tests**

Use hand-derived UTF-8 strings and laid-out runs to test forward/reversed ranges,
multiple runs, multiple regions, empty gutters, Unicode boundaries, and plain
copy ordering.

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify RED**

Run:

```bash
cargo test -p gpui-base text_selection::tests::plain --lib
```

Expected: compilation fails because run registration and projection are absent.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement run projection**

Expose:

```rust
pub struct SelectionRunFrame {
    pub order: u64,
    pub text: SharedString,
    pub layout: TextLayout,
    pub bounds: Bounds<Pixels>,
}

pub struct SelectionRunState {
    pub byte_range: Option<Range<usize>>,
    pub active: bool,
}
```

Move the renderer-neutral geometric band calculation into base, keep ranges on
UTF-8 boundaries, cache selected substrings for plain copy, and demonstrate a
non-TextView selectable renderer in the example.

- [ ] **Step 4: Verify GREEN**

Run:

```bash
cargo test -p gpui-base text_selection --lib
cargo check -p gpui-base --example selectable_text
```

Expected: plain adapter contracts and example compile successfully.

---

### Task 3: TextView advanced adapter and single state source

**Files:**
- Create: `crates/ui/src/text/selection_adapter.rs`
- Modify: `crates/ui/src/text/mod.rs`
- Modify: `crates/ui/src/text/text_view.rs`
- Modify: `crates/ui/src/text/inline.rs`
- Modify: `crates/ui/src/text/state.rs`
- Modify: `crates/ui/src/text/window_selection.rs`
- Modify: `crates/ui/src/root.rs`
- Modify: `crates/ui/src/global_state.rs`
- Test: `crates/ui/src/text/window_selection.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: base host, region, snapshot, run registration, focus/scroll/copy adapter hooks.
- Produces: TextView integration backed only by the base host, including Markdown source and virtual block export.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add compatibility assertions before migration**

Keep the existing selection tests unchanged and add assertions that Root contains
no second selection after adapter installation. Add an integration fixture where
a base plain region and a TextView participate in one cross-region selection.

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify the compatibility baseline**

Run:

```bash
cargo test -p gpui-component text::window_selection::tests --lib
```

Expected: existing tests pass; the mixed-adapter test fails because TextView is
not registered with the base host.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement `TextViewSelectionAdapter`**

Give each `TextViewState` a stable base region. Register its frame in
`TextView::paint`, register Inline runs during Inline paint, query base snapshots
for highlights, and attach callbacks for `selected_text_in`, focus, auto-scroll,
clear, and virtual block lookup.

- [ ] **Step 4: Remove the old authoritative state**

Delete Root's `WindowTextSelection`, selectable-view map, and inline-bounds map.
Move the old controller implementation to base, retain only TextView adapter
logic in `selection_adapter.rs`, and make every TextView selection query read the
base host.

- [ ] **Step 5: Verify GREEN**

Run:

```bash
cargo test -p gpui-component text::window_selection::tests --lib
cargo test -p gpui-component text::text_view::tests --lib
```

Expected: the unchanged compatibility suite and mixed-adapter test pass.

### Task 4: Scope migration, deprecated forwarding, and completion

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/ui/src/root.rs`
- Modify: `crates/ui/src/sheet.rs`
- Modify: `crates/ui/src/dialog.rs`
- Modify: `crates/ui/src/window_ext.rs`
- Modify: `crates/ui/src/text/window_selection.rs`
- Test: `crates/ui/src/text/window_selection.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `SelectionScopeId` and `WindowTextSelectionExt` from base.
- Produces: opaque modal scope mapping and deprecated component-layer forwarding to the single base host.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing forwarding and scope tests**

Assert that base and deprecated component window methods observe the same
selection, clearing through either interface clears both, and active Dialog or
Sheet regions remain isolated.

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify RED**

Run:

```bash
cargo test -p gpui-component text::window_selection::tests --lib
```

Expected: new base-forwarding assertions fail until the component methods use
the base extension.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement scope and forwarding**

Map Root modal state to opaque scope IDs, move the scope marker to base, install
the base controller automatically, and mark old selection methods deprecated
with migration notes. Use fully-qualified calls internally to avoid extension
trait ambiguity.

- [ ] **Step 4: Delete obsolete UI selection infrastructure**

Remove `ui::text::window_selection` once all remaining code is adapter-specific,
or reduce it to integration tests if Rust module locality requires that location.
There must be no second anchor/cursor or registration map in `gpui-component`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the completion gate**

Run:

```bash
cargo test -p gpui-base --lib
cargo test -p gpui-component --lib
cargo check --workspace
cargo fmt --all -- --check
git diff --check
```

Expected: every command exits successfully. Search additionally for old Root
selection fields and confirm no duplicate state remains.
